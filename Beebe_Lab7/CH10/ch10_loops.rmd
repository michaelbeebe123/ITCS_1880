1. for Loops
--
```{r Create a simple for loop the will iterate through the numbers 1 - 10 and multiply each by 3}

for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i * 3)
}

```

```{r Create a vector variable called "scooby.gang"}

scooby.gang <- c(
  "Scooby-Doo",
  "Shaggy Rogers",
  "Fred Jones",
  "Daphne Blake",
  "Velma Dinkley"
)

```

```{r find the length of the character names in scooby.gang and print them to the screen}

scoobyLength <- 0

for (i in scooby.gang) {
  print(nchar(i))
  scoobyLength <- scoobyLength + nchar(i)
}

print(glue("\n\nTotal of the characters in all of the strings: {scoobyLength}"))

```

2. while Loops
--
```{r In a while loop:}

n1 <- 10
n2 <- 2

while (n1 > n2) {
  print(n1)
  n1 <- n1 - 1
}

```
