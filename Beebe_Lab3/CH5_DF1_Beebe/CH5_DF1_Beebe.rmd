```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Create 3 vectors: x, y  and z.}
x <- c(1:10)
y <- c(10:1)
z <- c(x*3)
```

```{r Create a data frame called myDF that will hold the x, y and z vectors.}
myDF <- data.frame(x, y, z)
myDF
```

```{r Now, instead of x*3, set z to hold y*3}
z <- c(y*3)
myDF <- data.frame(x, y, z)
```

```{r Include code that will print myDF to the console again. What is different?}
myDF
```

We can now see that the z variable in myDF has been changed from x* 3 to y *3

```{r Issue 3 typeof() statements - one for each vector. Why is z different?}
typeof(x)
typeof(y)
typeof(z)
```

z is different because it is the result of a mathematical operation.

```{r Issue an is.vector(z) statement - what value do you get?}
is.vector(z)
```
```{r Issue an is.data.frame(myDF) statement - what value do you get?}
is.data.frame(myDF)
```
